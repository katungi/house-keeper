<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
House Keeper is a [GitHub app](https://developer.github.com/v3/apps/) that merges all the pull requests created by dependabot when the [installation_repositories](https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/types/#installation_repositoriesevent) webhook event for `added` action is fired.
All pull requests opened by dependabot are merged when a repository is added to app.

The app also subscribes [pull_request](https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/types/#pullrequestevent) webhook event of `opened` action type and merges a pull request opened by dependabot on the allowed repositories.
